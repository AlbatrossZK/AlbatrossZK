Privacy Infrastructure for Solana  
Zero-knowledge cryptography meets user-friendly design.

Albatross is building the missing privacy layer for Solana. While Solana delivers speed and low fees, true financial privacy has been absent. Every transaction, balance, and interaction is permanently public. Albatross exists to change that.

## Mission

Privacy as Default

We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a premium feature. Our mission is to provide accessible, secure, and intuitive privacy tools that protect financial sovereignty on Solana.

## Vision

Your Data. Your Control.

A world where users control their financial data, AI interactions remain confidential, and proving eligibility does not require exposing sensitive information.

## The Protocol

Albatross consists of five core privacy modules:

### AI Agent
Uncensored large language model powered by x402 micropayments. No logs, no history, no restrictions.

### Stealth Addresses
One-time receiving addresses for each transaction, enabling unlinkable payments.

### Payment Proofs
Prove payments without revealing amounts or counterparties through selective disclosure.

### Confidential Transfers
Encrypted Token-2022 USDC transfers where only transacting parties see amounts.

### ZK Access Pass
Zero-knowledge verification to prove eligibility without exposing wallet data.

## Principles

- Privacy by default  
- User-owned data  
- Minimal disclosure  
- Security with usability
