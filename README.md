**Privacy Infrastructure for Solana**  
Zero-knowledge cryptography meets user-friendly design.

Albatross is building the missing privacy layer for Solana. While Solana delivers speed and low fees, true financial privacy has remained absent. Every transaction, balance, and interaction is permanently public. Albatross exists to change that.

## Mission

**Privacy as Default**

We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a premium feature. Our mission is to deliver accessible, secure, and intuitive privacy tools that protect financial sovereignty on Solana.

## Vision

**Your Data. Your Control.**

We envision a world where users control their financial data, AI interactions remain confidential, and proving eligibility does not require exposing sensitive information.

## The Protocol

Albatross consists of five core privacy modules:

### AI Agent
An uncensored large language model powered by x402 micropayments. No logs, no history, no restrictions.

### Stealth Addresses
One-time receiving addresses generated per transaction, enabling fully unlinkable payments.

### Payment Proofs
Cryptographic proofs that validate payments without revealing amounts or counterparties, enabling selective disclosure.

### Confidential Transfers
Encrypted Token-2022 USDC transfers where only the transacting parties can view amounts.

### ZK Access Pass
Zero-knowledge verification to prove eligibility without exposing wallet data or transaction history.

## Principles

- Privacy by default  
- User-owned data  
- Minimal disclosure  
- Security without sacrificing usability
